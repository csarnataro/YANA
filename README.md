# YANA - Yet Another Notes App

Demo app for the "Natively Fluttering in the hybrid world" talk that took place on the 7th of February 2019.


## Talk description
Flutter has been around for a while, and it’s getting huge and real.

But what is it? What does it make it so special?

We’ll explore the Flutter architecture and its difference with the mainstream hybrid solutions. 
Walking together through the YANA app, we’ll explore what are some commonly used widgets, used to build layouts at super speed, how hot reloading our app makes really smooth our workflow. 
Going further, we’ll see how to keep ourselves synced thanks to the firebase plugins, which make authentication and database work super easy, and to save little pieces of data on board easily. 
Common basic widget are not the only widgets we’ll see, as we’ll see some more advanced stuff that we can use to easily build UI accordingly to the network state.

## Yeah but, do you have any slides? 
Yep! You can find them at the link below!
